    <p id="intro"> The concept of</p>

    <div class ="flex">
        <p class="book news" style="max-width:350px"> 
            There is no greater terror in this world than time, flitting about, 
            just out of vision and reach, one may flee to the ends of the world to avoid its presence, 
            or else disguise it amidst a thousand pleasures. But when the day is spent, every grain of sand drained, 
            then time will once again reveal itself, in all of its unknown horrors. 
            <br>

            In our daily lives, we may not take time for granted, but we habitually live by a regimented 
            measure of time. Our schedules are oftentimes full of entries such as “9:10 a.m. Greek Lecture” 
            or “3:45 p.m. Classes, jobs, even recreation may be calculated down to a precise minute or even 
            second. Unfailingly, we base our entire day around time, secure in the knowledge that as everything 
            else ebbs and flows around us, time will remain constant, ticking an inexorable march forward. 
        </p>

        <p class="book news" style="max-width:350px;">
            However, looking into anywhere but the present, we would come to the realization that time, 
            at least as we know it, was (and presumably still is) anything but a neutral construct. 
            We may live by time, depend on it, and even come to be enslaved by it, but the reassurance of 
            its constancy rests upon ephemeral foundations. If anything else, the constancy and precision 
            of time as we know it (insofar as it is possible to “know” time) is a recent construction. 
            <br>
            This does not bear on the linear progression of time or time as an aggregated concept. 
            Rather, time as we’ve seen it, the 12s, the 5s, the 60s  swirling about us in a constant, 
            and yet maddeningly arbitrary swirl of progression, is a fabrication, much like baloney, 
            pedigree dog breeds, and fashion items. To wit, the ability to calculate time down to its 
            very minutiae, is a product of modernity, for good or for worse. 
        </p>

        <p class="cursive blob" style="max-width:550px;margin-top: 200px;margin-left: 50px;font-size:25pt;" >
            Then if time is not the precise ticking of seconds to minutes, minutes to hours, 
            and hours to days, what is time? Is it an abstract toy of science? A gold inlaid toy of 
            dilettants manufactured by the swiss, or something else altogether?
